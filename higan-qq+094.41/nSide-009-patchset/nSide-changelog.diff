+﻿nSide v009 (2015-03-01)
+
+A fork of higan v094r08 by byuu (http://byuu.org/emulation/higan/), which was
+renamed to exclude "higan" at byuu's request.
+Individual emulators are also renamed to the following:
+bnes  -> nSide-fc
+bsnes -> nSide-sfc
+bgb   -> nSide-gb
+bgba  -> nSide-gba
+
+nSide adds new devices to the Famicom emulator's controller ports. The supported
+devices are:
+*Standard controller
+*Four Score
+*Zapper (port 2 only)
+*Power Pad (port 2 only)
+
+In addition, it adds the Famicom expansion port for its own devices. The only
+expansion port devices supported are:
+*Standard controller (counts as Player 3)
+*4-Players Adaptor
+*Beam Gun (Zapper)
+*Family Trainer (Power Pad)
+*VS. Panel (VS. arcade games only; if you try to select this for a Famicom or
+  PlayChoice-10 game, it instead selects None, though the menu does not properly
+  recognize that the device change failed)
+
+Please be aware that a great majority of Famicom and NES games support the use
+of Player 3 and Player 4 as substitutes for Player 1 and Player 2, including
+ones that use the NES Four Score such as A Nightmare on Elm Street. If the
+expansion slot is not explicitly set to "None", this can result in Player 3's
+controller controlling both Player 1 and Player 3.
+
+The Export Memory function for the Super Famicom emulator now exports a limited
+selection of PPU registers in BML format and expansion chip memory (except for
+the NEC DSPs). The Famicom and Game Boy emulators will also dump their RAMs but
+not registers. Note that this function was removed in higan v094r06 but
+preserved in nSide.
+
+nSide uses different directories for storing configuration settings, save
+states, and shaders so as to not conflict with higan.
+In Windows, the configuration files are in "%AppData%\nSide".
+
+You will need the GBA BIOS to play Game Boy Advance games. This is no different
+from higan.
+
+GBA BIOS
+sha256: fd2547724b505f487e6dcb29ec2ecff3af35a841a77ab2e85fd87350abd36570
+
+In addition, the PlayChoice-10 takes 3 files:
+
+BIOS for dual-screen
+sha256: 12200cee0965b871d2a47ac09ef563214d1b1a8355beda8bd477e21a561682e8
+
+BIOS for single-screen
+sha256: 64c1a7debf4729941c60e4c722ed61282ebd2f36928a30e55c9631477ce522ac
+
+Composite character ROM (3 files 8P + 8M + 8K put together for a 24KB ROM)
+sha256: a8bf9c58e31dee0a60a2d480bd707c323212fba8963cc35a47423cadd1d7ed26
+
+Composite palette ROM (3 files 6F + 6E + 6D put together—each byte is the
+corresponding nybble with a leading 0—for a 768-byte ROM)
+sha256: 9f639da2e0248431b59a9344769a38fad8b64742ce6e0e44534e6918b8977a0a)
+
+...but if you do not wish to emulate the Game Boy Advance or PlayChoice-10, none
+of these files are necessary. Keep in mind that PlayChoice-10 emulation is still
+incomplete, so these files will not be very useful right now.
+
+Known Bugs:
+Famicom:
+  *Saving a state while the Zapper or Beam Gun is connected will cause the
+  emulator to hang. If the cursor was captured, it can be hard to rescue.
+  *The VS. Zapper with its own separate protocol is badly supported (timing of
+  light sensor is not well understood).
+Super Famicom:
+  *Magical Drop (JP) (1.0) does not play voice effects, and it hangs when trying
+  to show the Game Over screen in Endless Mode (とことんモード).
+  Inherited from higan v094.
+  *Super Bonk's demo sequence is mis-timed. Bonk falls short of entering a pipe,
+  which ruins the rest of the demo as he continues reading inputs and gets stuck
+  in the area above the pipe. It is likely that this bug is related to the
+  Magical Drop bug above.
+  Inherited from higan v094.
+
+=========================
+Changes in v009: nSide-fc
+=========================
+./fc/fc.hpp
+   Changed the serializer version from 127 to 0. That serializer version was a
+  holdover from before this fork was renamed to "nSide" to prevent bnes save
+  states from loading. Because nSide's save states are stored in a separate
+  folder from higan's save states, keeping serializer versions synchronized is
+  not necessary. From now on, if a major release changes the serialization data,
+  the serializer version will increment.
+
+./fc/memory/memory.cpp
+./fc/memory/memory.hpp
+./fc/memory/memory-inline.hpp
+./fc/interface/interface.cpp
+./fc/cartridge/*
+   Imported bsnes's Memory struct with StaticRAM and MappedRAM sub-structs and
+  replaced all references to Board::Memory with references to MappedRAM,
+  removing Board::Memory in the process. With this change, the Famicom
+  emulator's structure is further modernized towards bsnes's standard.
+  Board::Memory was causing a crash when more of them were added for the
+  PlayChoice-10's instruction and key ROMs.

+./fc/cartridge/board/jaleco-jf-0x.cpp

+   Added support for the following boards:
+    HVC-UN1ROM             // 戦場の狼 (Senjou no Ookami) (JP)
+    BANDAI-74*161/161/32   // Kamen Rider Club (JP)

+./fc/arcade/pc10/pc10.cpp
+./fc/arcade/pc10/pc10.hpp
+./fc/ppu/ppu.cpp
+./fc/ppu/ppu.hpp
+./fc/video/video.cpp
+   Added emulation of PPU open bus behavior according to the notes blargg wrote
+  when he published his ppu_open_bus demo. ppu.status.mdr will decay to 0x00 if
+  not refreshed after about 600 milliseconds, and reading from the palette will
+  put the 2 highest MDR bits into the read value.
+   The PAL PPU swaps the red and green color emphasis bits.
+   Changed PPU timing to account for the dummy tick in front of every scanline.
+  bnes had pixel rendering on ticks 0-255 of every scanline, whereas an actual
+  PPU renders on ticks 1-256.
+   Prepared the video renderer for dynamic adjustment of screen width for
+  VS. DualSystem and PlayChoice-10 games. To set the width to 512 pixels for a
+  VS. DualSystem game, add a second "vs" node with a "ppu" child. It is not
+  enough to simply have a 2nd "vs" node, said node needs to have a "ppu" node as
+  a child to activate the double width. This is currently not useful because of
+  lack of true DualSystem support. The height is set to 480 if using the
+  PlayChoice-10's dual screen mode (set in PlayChoice-10.sys/manifest.bml), and,
+  as a basic demonstration of the horrid frame-based renderer, it will display
+  the PlayChoice-10 logo at the top as you play.
+
+./fc/cartridge/chip/mmc3.cpp
+   Made the MMC3 read the PPU's address bus (status.chr_abus) instead of ticking
+  on every CHR ROM/RAM read.
+   Added support for Acclaim's MC-ACC chip, which fires IRQs on PPU A12 falling
+  edges instead of rising edges. Needed to properly display The Incredible Crash
+  Dummies's messages during its intro.
+
+==========================
+Changes in v009: nSide-gba
+==========================
+./gba/gba.hpp
+./gba/alt/cpu/*
+   Added an alternate CPU that ignores ROM read delays. This alternate CPU will
+  be selected when using the balanced or performance profiles, and the main CPU
+  will be used in the accuracy profile.
+  This change is not ideal, and it only exists as a work-around for the lack of
+  documentation on ROM prefetch.
+
+=========================
+Changes in v008: nSide-fc
+=========================
+./fc/interface/interface.cpp
+./fc/interface/interface.hpp
+./fc/controller/*
+   Overhauled the procedure for adding devices to fix a bug in which the wrong
+  device is polled if the inter-port and intra-port ID numbers are not the same.
+
+./fc/cartridge/board/vs.cpp
+./fc/memory/memory.cpp
+./fc/ppu/ppu.cpp
+./fc/ppu/ppu.hpp
+   Moved some VS. System-specific features from the VS. cartridge board class
+  into the VS. Arcade board class.
+   The VS. System PPU has 4 KB of NVRAM instead of 2 KB. The PPU class now
+  allocates 4 KB, but when playing a Famicom or PlayChoice-10 game, only 2 KB
+  will be available, much like the Game Boy vs. the Game Boy Color.
+
+./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/single-chip.cpp
+   Fixed an error in CHR RAM mapping for the Single Chip board (Magic Floor).
+
+./fc/controller/controller.cpp
+./fc/controller/beamgun/beamgun.cpp
+./fc/controller/beamgun/beamgun.hpp
+./fc/controller/vsbeamgun/vsbeamgun.cpp
+./fc/controller/vsbeamgun/vsbeamgun.hpp
+./fc/system/input.cpp
+   Consolidated the VS. Zapper's unique protocol into the main Beam Gun class.
+
+========================
+Changes in v007: General
+========================
+./target-<emulator_name>/Makefile
+./*.bat
+   Imported changes from quequotion's higan-qq fork to remove the "install as
+  root" requirement for all platforms and increase command-line options.
+  You can now specify a name for the compiled executable. See the *.bat files
+  for examples.
+
+./target-<emulator_name>/<emulator_name>.cpp
+./target-<emulator_name>/settings/advanced.cpp
+   Made the Profile text in the About information only load if the Super Famicom
+  emulator is included. This means removing the Super Famicom emulator takes the
+  same amount of effort as removing the Famicom and Game Boy Advance emulators
+  (and Game Boy emulator, but only if the Super Famicom emulator is also
+  removed).
+
+=========================
+Changes in v007: nSide-fc
+=========================
+./fc/ppu/ppu.cpp
+   Fixed an order of operations error that was preventing VS. System games that
+  use the RC2C05 PPUs from working properly. Needed to play VS. Ninja
+  Jajamaru-kun.
+
+./fc/arcade/pc10/pc10.cpp
+./fc/arcade/pc10/pc10.hpp
+./fc/interface/interface.cpp
+./fc/interface/interface.hpp
+./fc/system/system.cpp
+   The PlayChoice-10 board will now load the BIOS from the install directory's
+  PlayChoice-10.sys folder and throw a warning if one is not found, but because
+  it is not actually used in any way, you can put any 16384-byte file in there
+  to avoid the warning.
+   Which PPU to use is now decided by the presence of the "pc10" node in the
+  cartridge manifest, so if you want to bypass loading the PlayChoice-10 BIOS
+  while still using the RGB PPU, rename a ".pc10" folder to ".fc".
+
+==========================
+Changes in v007: nSide-sfc
+==========================
+./sfc/cartridge/markup.cpp
+   When loading a Nintendo Super System game, if the manifest has no DIP switch
+  settings, the emulator will not prompt you to set the DIP switches.
+   A total of 4 Nintendo Super System games do not have DIP switches:
+  Super Mario World
+  F-Zero
+  Super Tennis
+  Super Soccer
+
+========================
+Changes in v006: General
+========================
+./*
+   Migrated changes between higan v094 and higan v094r08 concerning changes to
+  nall, phoenix, ruby, and the UI. This has resulted in the name "ethos" being
+  dropped, so now "target-ethos" has been renamed to "target-<emulator_name>".
+   The requirement that "make install must be run as root" was altered to not
+  apply to Windows or Mac OS X.
+   loki has been added to the source code.
+   However, the exportMemory function was not removed like it was in higan
+  v094r06. There is a 3rd-party tool that depends on exportMemory to work, and
+  said tool will stop working if exportMemory is removed.
+
+=========================
+Changes in v006: nSide-fc
+=========================
+./fc/interface/interface.cpp
+  exportMemory now dumps cartridge PRG RAM and CHR RAM.

+./fc/system/serialization.cpp
+   The VS. System's modifications to the Famicom's structure are extensive and
+  need a new class to be done justice.
+   The CPU had unused variables related to reading the controllers, so they were
+  removed.
+   The Zapper works completely different for the VS. System compared to the
+  Famicom. To customize the Zapper's inputs for VS. games, customize the Zapper
+  in Port 2, not the Beam Gun in the expansion port.

+./sfc/memory/memory-inline.hpp
+   Migrated changes between higan v094 and higan v094r01 concerning the Super
+  Game Boy and the Bus::reduce method.
+  It seems that, previously, Space Invaders could not load the SNES version, but
+  with this change, now it can. Why is that, and was it a known bug?

+./fc/cpu/timing.cpp
+./fc/input/input.cpp
+./fc/system/serialization.cpp
+./fc/video/video.cpp
+   Overhauled the device implementation to depend on controller objects like in
+  the Super Famicom emulator. The amateur mistake of omitting "break;" after
+  every case statement was what prevented this from happening earlier.
+   Added buggy support for the Zapper. Use it the same way you would use the
+  Super Scope (press F12 to capture the cursor), but it sometimes misses even
+  when it should hit.
+  Light is defined as any Famicom color with a luma of 0x20 or greater and a
+  chroma less than 0x0D, not taking into account emphasis or RGB PPUs.
+   Refined the draw_cursor method to depend on the Zapper controller object 
+  instead of the Input object. If both a Zapper and Beam Gun are connected, 2
+  cursors are drawn and can be moved separately. Orange represents the Zapper,
+  and dark gray represents the Beam Gun.
+   Added the ability to directly connect a standard controller into the
+  expansion port where it will count as Player 3 (Famicom style). Because of a
+  limitation of the UI, this will be the default controller for the slot.
+   Added the Family Trainer as an expansion port alternative to the Power Pad,
+  much like the Beam Gun for the Zapper.
+

+./fc/interface/interface.hpp
+./fc/system/system.cpp
+./fc/cartridge/board/board.cpp
+./fc/cartridge/board/vs.cpp
+   Added basic and buggy support for the VS. System. Only UniSystem games will
+  work right now (Tennis and Baseball are DualSystem games that would require
+  emulating 2 Famicoms). The Start and Select buttons are disabled in favor of
+  Buttons 1, 2, 3, and 4, which can be configured in the new Famicom Expansion
+  device, the VS. Panel. The VS. Panel also controls the service button and coin
+  slots. It is connected automatically and cannot be disconnected, but a
+  limitation of the UI prevents the interface from acknowledging that a device
+  change was refused.
+   VS. games are stored in a separate "VS. System" folder in the library, just
+  like PlayChoice-10 games. The VS. manifest format selects the PPU revision in
+  "cartridge/vs/ppu/revision" and specifies DIP switch settings in the same
+  format as the Nintendo Super System's DIP switch settings
+  ("cartridge/vs/setting/option/value").
+  Example:
+  cartridge
+    vs
+      setting name="Price"
+        option value=0x00 name="1 Coin - 1 Credit"
+        option value=0x07 name="Free Play"

+===================================================
+Changes in v004: processor/r6502 (affects nSide-fc)
+===================================================
+./processor/r6502/r6502.cpp
+./processor/r6502/r6502.hpp
+./processor/r6502/instructions.cpp
+   BRK was improperly clearing the Decimal flag when it should leave it alone.
+  Only the interrupt flag is set now.
+   An NMI can now redirect a BRK if it occurs after BRK's 4th cycle (after
+  pushing the return vector into the stack but before pushing register P).
+   Opcode 0x80 was being treated as NOP abs, when it should be NOP #imm.
+  NOP #imm now advances the program counter properly, fixing Puzznic's columns
+  of corruption bug.
+   Added support for the unofficial opcodes ALR, ANC, AXS, DCP, ISC (ISB), LAX,
+  RLA, RRA, SAX, SLO, SRE, and STP (KIL).
+
+=========================
+Changes in v004: nSide-fc
+=========================
+./fc/cartridge/board/bandai-fcg.cpp
+   Added support for BANDAI-JUMP2, the only LZ93D50 variant to use SRAM instead
+  of EEPROM. Needed to play ファミコンジャンプII 最強の７人 (Famicom Jump II).
+
+./fc/cartridge/board/nes-txrom.cpp
+   Prevented saving to non-existent SRAM/WRAM.
+
+./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/nina.cpp
+   Fixed a bug in AVE-NINA-01 and AVE-NINA-02 that was causing writes out of
+  $6000-7FFF to save to SRAM (causing, among other things, the program stack to
+  be copied into $6100-61FF), so now Impossible Mission II will run.
+
+=====================
+Changes in v004: Misc
+=====================
+./Makefile
+./reinstall.bat
+   Fixed a bug that was causing the accuracy build to show "Balanced Profile" in
+  the advanced settings (and Cocoa's about box?) despite not actually being
+  the Balanced profile.
+   Eliminated "Makefile-accuracy" and "Makefile-balanced" by using an --eval
+  command in the batch file to select the profile.
+
+============================
+Changes in v004: ananke
+============================
+./ananke/famicom.cpp
+./ananke/heuristics/famicom.hpp
+   Added support for PRG ROMs that are 8192 bytes long, half the minimum size
+  needed for iNES and NES 2.0. If a 16384-byte PRG ROM has 2 halves with the
+  same data, it is truncated to 8192 bytes.
+   NES 2.0 submappers are now supported for the Konami VRC4 (iNES 21, 23, and
+  25).
+
+=====================
+Past Changes: General
+=====================
+   Changed "higan" to "nSide" and added a Contributors field for Ryphecha and
+  Cydrak, which were credited in comments in fc.hpp and gba.hpp, on the
+  Configuration Settings Advanced tab and Cocoa About box.
+  Credited blargg and Jonas Quinn as contributors to higan (blargg wrote the
+  DSP code for the compatibility and performance cores, and Jonas Quinn
+  contributed many fixes for the SFC DSPs and the Game Boy).
+  There may still be more that I am missing, so let me know if you or someone
+  else needs to be credited.
+
+   Moved "<configpath>/higan/library.bml" to "<configpath>/nSide/library.bml".
+
+   Reformatted the "About" text to show contributors to higan and show which
+  program nSide branched from.
+  Also applies to the Cocoa compilation target's unique About box.
+
+   Renamed "{game}/bsnes" folder for save states to "{game}/nSide"
+  (was "{game}/higan" in higan v094r01 and in nSide's earliest builds prior to
+  the v001 release).
+
+======================
+Past Changes: nSide-fc
+======================
+   Revised emulator name and copyright information.
+
+   Moved video.cpp and video.hpp into fc/system and changed references to point
+  to the new location.
+
+   Added new board types referenced in the following files:
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/namco-34xx.cpp // SkyKid (JP), The Quest of Ki (JP)
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/sunsoft4.cpp   // After Burner (JP)
+    ./fc/cartridge/chip/namco-108.cpp
+
+   Added aliases for existing board classes:

+    TENGEN-800008 to NES-CNROM    // Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game (NA)
+    TENGEN-800042 to SUNSOFT-4    // After Burner (NA)
+
+   Added new unlicensed board types referenced in the following files (note that
+  they are sectioned off separately from the licensed ones for easy removal):
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/camerica.cpp          // Micro Machines
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/colordreams-74377.cpp // Bible Adventures
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/mlt-action52.cpp      // Action 52
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/nina.cpp              // Impos. Msn. II
+    ./fc/cartridge/board/unlicensed/single-chip.cpp       // Magic Floor (no$)
+   Many games published on Camerica boards were made by Codemasters who is
+  notorious for exploiting rarely-used aspects of the NES. This is not a problem
+  with the Camerica board but with Famicom hardware timing.
+
+   The board definitions for the following board families now read the board and
+  chip types and choose a board and chip revisions accordingly:
+    NROM
+      HROM has no solder pads to select mirroring and is locked to vertical
+      mirroring.
+    SxROM (MMC1)
+      SEROM, SHROM, and SH1ROM have pin A14 hooked directly between the control
+      deck and the program ROM, which prevents the ROM from being bankswitched.
+      Prevented reading from and writing to non-existent PRG RAM. This bug
+      prevented Bionic Commando from booting.
+      Added tracking of the last CHR bank used, so that the legacy PRG RAM
+      disable bit and 256 KB PRG bank bit will dynamically switch as the PPU
+      renders. Can be used for software IRQs but will catastrophically crash the
+      game if misused.
+    TxROM (MMC3)
+      Added TQROM support, which has both CHR-ROM and CHR-RAM (selected via bit
+      6 of the bank number). Needed to play High Speed and Pin Bot.
+      Added TxSROM support, which selects mirroring via bit 7 of whichever CHR
+      banks control PPU $0000..$0FFF. Needed to play Armadillo.
+      Added support for TVROM. TR1ROM support already existed, which provides
+      four-screen mirroring, but it did not recognize TVROM as also having it.
+      Needed to play Rad Racer II.
+    ExROM (MMC5)
+      Fixed a bug in CHR mode 0 concerning background access to the PPU.
+      Originally, though an increment of 1 to $512B advanced by 0x2000 bytes,
+      PPU $1000..$1FFF acted as a mirror of $0000..$0FFF, making the latter half
+      of each bank inaccessible. It now accesses the latter half of the bank.
+      Sprite access was not affected by the bug.
+    AxROM
+    PxROM
+    FxROM
+
+   Added bus conflict emulation to the following board families (assuming that
+  the written value is ANDed with the ROM byte):
+    UxROM
+      Added support for the 74HC08 chip, which is required to play Crazy
+      Climber. Normal UxROM games use the 74HC32 chip.
+    CxROM
+      Added support for CPROM, which restricts PPU $0000-0FFF to the first bank
+      while $1000-1FFF is a 4KB switchable bank. Needed to play Videomation.
+      Added support for CNROM security CHR chip enables. Each game has a
+      specific CHR bank that is read from
+      manifest["cartridge/board/security/pass"], and that bank is the only one
+      that maps in the CHR. Spy vs. Spy uses 0x1.
+    AxROM (AMROM only; AOROM has no quality database coverage)
+    BNROM
+    GNROM/MHROM
+
+   Added support for VRC2a, which is similar to VRC2c except that CHR banks are
+  right-shifted by 1. "cartridge/chip/pinout/chr-shift" indicates the shift
+  amount, with 0 used by VRC2b and VRC2c, and 1 used by VRC2a.
+  VRC2a was used in ツインビー3 ポコポコ大魔王 (TwinBee 3: The Aimless Demon King).
+  VRC2b was used in 魂斗羅 (Contra).
+  VRC2c was used in がんばれゴエモン外伝 けいた黄金キセル (Ganbare Goemon Gaiden).
+
+   The variants VRC4a, VRC4b, VRC4d, VRC4e, and VRC4f (if it exists) were all
+  supported already, but VRC4c had been locked out, making it impossible to
+  run がんばれゴエモン外伝2 天下の財宝 (Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2). Not anymore.
+  VRC4c's pinout is: "pinout a0=6 a1=7"
+
+   Added the ability to read the VRC6 pinout from manifest.bml. Before, it would
+  dynamically determine the pinout based on the presence of SRAM.
+  悪魔城伝説 (Akumajou Densetsu/Castlevania 3) uses "pinout a0=0 a1=1".
+  Esper Dream 2 and 魍魎戦記マダラ (Mouryou Senki Madara) use "pinout a0=1 a1=0".
+
+   Split chip code for the Bandai chips into a separate file alongside the MMCs
+  and VRCs.
+  Made register placement in the Bandai boards more strict based on board type.
+  "board type=???" determines how to lay out the registers.
+  FCG-1 and FCG-2 use $6000-7FFF, and LZ93D50 and JUMP2 uses $8000-FFFF.
+  Additionally, a second "chip type=???" line determines which type of EEPROM
+  to use (24C01 for 128-byte and 24C02 for 256-byte). Leave the second line out
+  to exclude EEPROM (and use SRAM if it exists). True EEPROM support is still
+  not in, however.
+  クレヨンしんちゃん オラとポイポイ (Crayon Shin-chan: Ora to Poi Poi) is the only game using
+  the LZ93D50 to not have any way of saving data, and
+  ファミコンジャンプII 最強の７人 (Famicom Jump II) is the only game on any variant of this
+  board to use normal SRAM at $6000-7FFF.
+
+   Added support for the Camerica boards ALGQ, BF9096 and BF9097. Needed to play
+  Fire Hawk and the Quattro multicarts.
+
+   The read registers at $4016 and $4017 only have 5 bits each, not 6, so
+  mdr() is ANDed with 0xe0 instead of 0xc0.
+
+   Added the ability to change controllers for the Famicom, which required
+  adding an Interface#connect method that calls Input#connect.
+   Added Four Score support. It is split into 2 devices, so for best results,
+  plug a Four Score into both slots.
+   Added support for the Power Pad.
+   Added support for the 4-Players Adaptor.
+
+   Added the exportMemory function, which can dump WRAM, CIRAM, CGRAM, and OAM.
+
+   Commented out a line in ppu_read for the OAMREAD register that was making
+  Magic Floor's ball sprite behave strangely. The mystery of this behavior is
+  still not solved, however: a shadow ball copies the ball's previous X
+  coördinate upon update, which does not appear in Nestopia or FCEUX.
+
+   Added PAL support, which reduces games to 50Hz. May or may not be complete.
+
+   Moved interface->videoRefresh into Video::update as part of the effort to add
+  a cursor for the NES Zapper.
+
+   Changed the Serializer version from 2 to 127. This step is necessary because
+  of the addition of the Famicom's expansion port. Why 127 instead of 3? To
+  account for official revisions in the future.
+
+   Added support for loading games with the .pc10 extension.
+  Currently, PlayChoice-10 games load the same way as Famicom games but with the
+  RGB palette in the 2C03. They won't even load PlayChoice-10-specific files, so
+  the BIOSes are not required to load games right now.
+  Note that RGB PPUs do not support the Color Emulation option or Display
+  Emulation shader. They display the same colors as when both are turned off.
+
+=======================
+Past Changes: nSide-sfc
+=======================
+   Revised emulator name and copyright information.
+
+   Changed reference to "bsnes" in HSU1::write to instead read "nSide-sfc".
+
+   Expanded exportMemory to dump expansion chip-specific memory. Currently, only
+  the SA-1, ST-018, and Cx4 are supported.
+
+   Added exportRegisters for exporting some PPU registers to a debug report in
+  BML format. Not all registers are supported yet.
+
+   Fixed a bug in drawing the cursor for the Super Scope and Justifier.
+  In draw_cursor, change all occurrences of "palette[pixelcolor]" to just
+  "pixelcolor".
+
+======================
+Past Changes: nSide-gb
+======================
+   Revised emulator name and copyright information.
+
+   Added the exportMemory function, which can dump WRAM, HRAM (internal RAM),
+  VRAM, OAM, and the palette, which is different for the Game Boy and Game Boy
+  Color.
+
+=======================
+Past Changes: nSide-gba
+=======================
+   Revised emulator name and copyright information.
+
+   Added the exportMemory function, which can dump External WRAM, Internal WRAM,
+  VRAM, and PRAM (Palette RAM).
+  However, dumping External WRAM causes a crash with about 3/4 of the data
+  dumped, so it has been temporarily disabled (External WRAM is 262144 bytes
+  long, the longest of any file dumped by any emulator's exportMemory function).
+
+=============================================
+Past Changes: ananke (formerly "ananke")
+=============================================
+   Renamed "ananke" to "ananke" in case byuu wants it renamed.
+
+   Added support for the following boards:
+    CPROM
+    UNROM+74HC08
+    TQROM
+    TVROM
+    NAMCOT-34xx
+
+   Revised the header information for iNES mappers 21, 23, 24, 25, and 26 to
+  correctly detect VRC4 and VRC6 pinouts more often (but in VRC4's case, still
+  not 100% of the time)
+
+   Revised the header information for iNES mappers 16, 153, and 159 to select
+  which type of EEPROM/SRAM to use for the Bandai FCG series of boards.
+
+   Began planning support for purification based on bootgod's database.
+
+   Added preliminary support for NES 2.0.
